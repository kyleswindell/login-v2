# Change Queue

This queue is agent-managed and implementation-ready. It is not a scratchpad.
- Exploratory review discussion stays in chat until normalized into concise queue language.
- Active queue items use stable IDs in the format `P<phase>-<batch>-CQ-###` (e.g. `P2-E-CQ-001`).
- `In Progress` marks the queue item currently claimed by the writable `work-batch` owner.
- An unfinished `In Progress` item must be continued or explicitly reclassified before a new `Ready To Implement` item is claimed.
